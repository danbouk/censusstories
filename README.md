# Every Census **Has** a Story
# Every Census _Is_ a Story

##To-day, I had my census took!
????name enumerator??? knocked on Madge C. Crandall's door in New York's upper West side on 10 April 1930 and the encounter irked Crandall. She pounded away a short poem on her typewriter and sent it to, who else, the President of the United States: Herbert Hoover.

"Today I had my census took!
I am recorded in the book-
What I do, how old I am.
All my secrets for Uncle Sam."

Later in the poem, Crandall objected to the question asking about radio ownership---it seemed to her a sneaky kind of economic status snooping. And, in a complaint that resonates across the decades, she mocked a question about citizenship status. [[check out Crandall's details]]

Crandall told Hoover: "Inclosed versified lines record my impression of this expensive census." Hoover, once the nation's most celebrated engineer, would have probably taken comfort that the criticism---coming in the early days of the Great Depression---was not worse. But he probably never saw it. His secretary sloughed it off onto a clerk the census bureau and it now persists in a file folder inscribed in part "Criticisms of Census, etc." in Washington D.C.'s National Archives Building. [[Entry 215, “Publicity Materials File of the Statistical Research Division” Box 231 Folder: “E-2 Experiences of 1930 Census Supervisors and Enumerators. Criticisms of Census, Etc.”]]
