# Every Census **Has** a Story
# Every Census _Is_ a Story

##To-day, I had my census took!
Mollie Levi knocked on Madge C. Crandall's door in New York's upper West side on 8 April 1930 and the encounter irked Crandall. Two days later, Crandall, a free-lance writer, pounded away a short poem on her typewriter and sent it to, who else, the President of the United States: Herbert Hoover. It began:

> "Today I had my census took!
> I am recorded in the book-
> What I do, how old I am.
> All my secrets for Uncle Sam."

Later in the poem, Crandall objected to the question asking about radio ownership---it seemed to her a sneaky kind of economic status snooping. And, in a complaint that resonates across the decades, she mocked a question about citizenship status.

Crandall told Hoover: "Inclosed versified lines record my impression of this expensive census." Hoover, once the nation's most celebrated engineer, might have taken comfort that the criticism---coming in the early days of the Great Depression---was not worse. But he probably never saw it. His secretary sloughed it off onto a clerk the census bureau and it now persists in a file folder inscribed in part "Criticisms of Census, etc." in Washington D.C.'s National Archives Building.

Mollie Levi appears nowhere in Crandall's poem. She's erased: a mere functionary who carried the book, did the recording. It's Uncle Sam who's really doing the asking, who's ultimately listening.

But Levi was there: she signed the enumeration sheet (which offers a different sort of account of the interview with Crandall).

Did it matter that Crandall spoke with a real person? It really might have.

Both women were widows. Crandall was the elder, at 56 to Levi's 44. Crandall lived alone in an apartment rented for $75 a month, while Levi lived with four nearly adult children in a $40 apartment. Crandall likely viewed Levi as a social inferior. Was she embarrassed to admit that she owned a radio, when she could readily infer (correctly) that Levi did not?

Crandall's experience of enumeration, because it left her so cranky that she "versified" it made me curious. What happened? What can we reconstruct about that day's events?

We have two records to hand: Crandall's poem and the manuscript census sheets from 1930. Reading them together, we can make some inferences.

First: Crandall's account erased the enumerator. There's no mention of Levi
(For the record: Mollie did not own a radio. Madge did. Crandall told Levi she was native born, and her parents were too: both hailed from New York. Levi had been born in New York too, while her father was English. Both were widowed)
