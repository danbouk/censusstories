## To-day, I had my census took!
Wednesday, 2 May 2018
Mollie Levi knocked on Madge C. Crandall's door in New York's upper West side on 8 April 1930 and the encounter irked Crandall. Two days later, Crandall, a free-lance writer, pounded away a short poem on her typewriter and sent it to, who else, the President of the United States: Herbert Hoover. It began:

> "Today I had my census took!</br>
> I am recorded in the book- </br>
> What I do, how old I am.</br>
> All my secrets for Uncle Sam."</br>


Later in the poem, Crandall objected to the question asking about radio ownership---it seemed to her a sneaky kind of economic status snooping. And, in a complaint that resonates across the decades, she mocked a question about citizenship status.

Crandall told Hoover: "Inclosed versified lines record my impression of this expensive census." Hoover, once the nation's most celebrated engineer, might have taken comfort that the criticism---coming in the early days of the Great Depression---was not worse. But he probably never saw it. His secretary sloughed it off onto a clerk the census bureau and it now persists in a file folder inscribed in part "Criticisms of Census, etc." in Washington D.C.'s National Archives Building.

Mollie Levi appears nowhere in Crandall's poem. She's erased: a mere functionary who carried the book, did the recording. It's Uncle Sam who's really doing the asking, who's ultimately listening.

But Levi was there: she signed the enumeration sheet (which offers a different sort of account of the interview with Crandall).

Did it matter that Crandall spoke with a real person? It really might have.

Both women were widows. Crandall was the elder, at 56 to Levi's 44. Crandall lived alone in an apartment rented for $75 a month, while Levi lived with four nearly adult children in a $40 apartment. Crandall likely viewed Levi as a social inferior. Was she embarrassed to admit that she owned a radio, when she could readily infer (correctly) that Levi did not?
