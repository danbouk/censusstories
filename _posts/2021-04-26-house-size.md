[Today](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2020-census-apportionment-results.html) the U.S. Census Bureau announced the official population totals for each state to be used in apportioning seats in the House of Representatives. [Here](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/dec/2020-apportionment-data.html) is the data the bureau released.

Everybody is talking about winners and losers. At the Bureau's press conference, almost every question from journalists had something to do with why a state had lost a seat or whether a state was close to gaining a seat. This is how it usually goes, because the current system sets apportionment up as a zero sum game. There are only 435 seats and they are apportioned automatically. If one state gains, another must lose. Check out my report ["House Arrest"](https://datasociety.net/library/house-arrest/) for more on how the House came to be fixed at 435 seats and for an explanation of the surprising role of an automated algorithmic system in sustaining the cap on the House's size.

Before the automated system first took hold in 1929, it wasn't a zero-sum game. On the contrary, the folks doing the census would usually complete their count of Americans (which would show a growing population) and then Congress would increase the size of the House. A ["Count and Increase" tradition](https://usapportionment.org/countandincrease.html) governed Congressional apportionment.

The Census Bureau understood this and it released data in a format that suited Congress's proclivities, like this:

![table showing all of the states in the US and then listing whether each gained or lost a seat for a House of 440 seats or 441 seats or 442 seats or 443 seats or 444 seats](/images/1920_440_444.png)


So, for instance, the bureau's chief statistician sent a series of 49 tables to Congress in late 1920. Each table represented a different sized House, ranging from 435 seats to 483.

![image of a report title that reads Apportionment of Each Number of Representatives from 435 Up to 483 Inclusive by the Method of Major Fractions](/images/1920_435_483_inclusive.png)

Those numbers were no accident. The Census Bureau believed it was highly unlikley that Congress could consider shrinking the House and so it started its calculations at 435. It ended them at 483 for an equally simple reason: that was the number where no state would lose a seat. And, indeed, it looked for a while like Congress would in fact settle on 483 seats. In the history of apportionment, Congress tended to settle on a House size that protected the seats of sitting members of Congress.

So I decided to pretend I was an early twentieth century Census Bureau employee preparing a new data transmission for Congress, in the spirit of Count and Increase. (I already had my spreadsheets set up to do the necessary calculations from back when I reconstructed the prominent apportionment methods for this [prior post](https://censusstories.us/2020/09/01/harvard-mimeograph.html).)

At a 454-seat House, there are no more losers. There are only winners.

For those who are curious, the apportionment method works by creating a priority value list. That list shows which state is next in line to get the next available seat for each increment in the size of the House. Here is the above table in the form of a priority value list.

- 436: New York (saves its seat)
- 437: Ohio (saves its seat)
- 438: Texas
- 439: Florida
- 440: Arizona
- 441: California (saves its seat)
- 442: Virginia
- 443: Idaho
- 444: Michigan (saves its seat)
- 445: New Jersey
- 446: Pennsylvania (saves its seat)
- 447: Massachusetts
- 448: Georgia
- 449: California
- 450: Texas
- 451: Washington
- 452: New York
- 453: Illinois (saves its seat)
- 454: West Virginia (saves its seat)
