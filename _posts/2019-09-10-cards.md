artisanal counting

Schnepf makes really clear how striking it is that the workers are missing in all the tabulation stuff...

This much I knew. But I did not realize until this week that when it came to doing the one thing the Constitution requires of the census---that is, actually counting the number of Americans for the purpose of deciding which states gain and which states lose representatives----when it comes to doing that fundamental, essential thing: cards or tabulators play no part. People count the population, by hand.

USE VANDENBURG?: Vandenberg to W. M. Steuart, 1 March 1929, File 406, Box 1, Record Group 29 — 227 – General Records 1900 1941
After apologizing that census bill is held up b/c tied to apportionment:
“I know it handicaps you and I consider it very unfortunate. On the other hand there is a vital basic principle involved in this whole quarrel which I believe is more important than anything else. I believe the census has but one constitutional function—namely to serve as the base for re-apportionment. I feel duty-bound and oath-bound to endeavor by every means at my command to force this view upon a recalcitrant Senate.”


explain how the count happens

contrast w/ the depictions -- the Post story, the cool diagram

close by reflecting on census as much more than political count...(and nod to power of technical fascination)


On a sticky day in August, I tottered out of the National Archives building, my brain an over-filled filing cabinet, stuffed silly with memos and miscellanei. The Smithsonian American Art Museum, [an old friend](/FUREDI????), tugged me north. But today I had business south: I had to find the new Census Building.  

A map from 1941, saved on my computer, spotted it just north of Virginia Avenue between second and third streets, southeast. That map doesn't show the railroad tracks that run next to Virginia Ave, and so I wasn't prepared for the steady thunder of the freight trains and commuter shuttles as I walked. They led me to the right spot though.

The new Census Building is no longer new. Nor is it the Census Building.

The plates on the wall revealed it to be the Ford Congressional Office Building. Thousands of clerks and punchcards had been replaced by, well, probably more clerks---but these ones worked for Congresspeople. From the east side of the building employees can see the dome of the Capitol. Cracks some plaster along the back hint at the 79 years that the building has seen, although from the north it remains as neat and orderly as a punch card.


When (and where) does a person become a statistic -- work out the difference between becoming a punch card and becoming a digit, or multiple digits...


Ullman's superhuman machines and the people who work with them...

but the most important count happened by hand!!

situate the schedule that ordinary person looks at -- not the end of the data-making: toward a person and a series of aggregates;
and in a later post will be turned into a microphotograph

difficulty of making sense of the tabulation process; or of making it not do deadly boring...

begin with critiques of making paper people, but then dig into how it works...?

thinking about how and why we tell stories about the tabulating machines, but less so about the people who operate them...(or is that just Mar Hick's point...?)--that machines seem more exciting than people; and what that means...or that the point was to make the people more like machines too...

Marie Fenlon turned people into punch cards. ..get to awful power of rationality...but is it really that awful...just a job...



work from AMAZING diagram in Dedrick 2, around image 1117 --- Entry 210, “General Records Maintained by Calvert Dedrick, 1935 – 1942” Box 221
Folder “Misc.—Government Organization Charts”

that diagram refers to how the schedules become cards A, B, E, and S.


"The Census Mechanical Laboratory made substantial advances in the 1940s and 50s, with the development of a multicolumn sorter and major improvements to the tabulator."(27)

SAY WHAT YOU MEAN BOUK

awesome and awful -- awe-filled, awe-inspiring -- the power of rationality and rationalizing

do something with the formal simularity of the office building, the boxes, the schedule, and the punch cards: all stacks and rows...maybe the city grid too

use image of all the boxes

1939: Space for Clerical Force:
“The Bureau is now six months behind in securing absolutely essential space. The Woodward and Lothrop warehouse building will be ready for our occupancy at the end of this week or early next week. It will house our division of Geography and our Field Division. Your attention, however, is called to the delay by the Treasury Department in beginning the construction of the Federal building at 2nd and 3rd Streets, D Street and Virginia Avenue, S.W. The appropriation was approved on March 15, 1939. This building must be completed by the end of the present calendar year and turned over to the Bureau of the Census for occupancy on January 3, 1940. The construction has not yet started. Further delay in securing necessary space will probably be fatal to the success of the 1940 census, with the time period given us by law and the amount of the appropriation made by the Congress.”

typed caption reads: "This new six-story building will house the approximately 7,000 clerks needed to compile the returns of the 1940 census. Population, housing, agriculture, irrigation and drainage, business, manufacturing and mines and quarries will be covered in this census which is the sixteenth time a national census has been taken since the first one in 1790."

also talk about census work as a kind of light industry--think about all those clerks and machines too--it's not just a metaphorical factory for knowledge (but we tend to erase the real infrastructure---just as we do in imagining away the internet's physicality)


1941: “Because of the recent changes, the personnel of the Division is now housed in four different locations. In the Commerce Building, the Acting Chief Statistician and several offices are located on the fifth floor, and the Negro Statistics section on the third floor. In the Census Building, the Acting Assistant Chief Statistician and the bulk of the technical personnel are located on the fourth floor, east wing, and Mr. Beales and the Statistical Abstract section are located in the central wing of the fourth floor.” (4) [FOUDRAY prob in 4th floor Census building]
