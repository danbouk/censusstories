Our teachers and their students, meeting on the Internet, could act as a reserve force to make sure our communities are fully counted, while keeping a waiting army of census enumerators out of harm's way for as long as necessary. That's my theory.

As I compose this post near the northern tip of Manhattan, my city is creaking under the weight of an extraordinary burden. COVID-19 has found more victims here than anywhere else in the United States. Hospitals have run out of necessary protective equipment. Schools are closed. Sidewalks are quiet. And the worst seems yet to come.

So, it's perhaps not surprising that on Census Day (April 1, 2020), New York lagged behind much of the United States in the race to get counted. [RANKINGS for a few PLACES---note this is even as overall self-response has been good.]

about us not having the Internet (about how to write this piece, I've turned off the internet, to find just a moment of piece---but I'll have to turn it back on to post, and then Tweet, etc.)
