It's been over 15 years since I married. For most of those years, I spoke of being a husband, of having a wife. That changed when the person who I married---and to whom I remain married---began what we did not then realize was a process that would end with *him* coming out as transgender. Gendered pronouns were to change, but first we wrestled with the language of relationship. We tried on "spouse" for a while---as in, "my spouse taught our son to climb trees," (which is true). I felt awkward in the usage at first---it isn't common---but eventually got used to it and even liked it. My spouse never did. We tossed around "partner," but wasn't that too businesslike? (Or maybe too queer for how we then made sense, or tried to, of ourselves.) But since spouse did not catch on, and "lover" only worked for a laugh, we landed on "partner" after all. I thought we were being very modern, that this was a new sort of relationship. Then a census-related query from historian [Ansley Erickson](http://www.tc.columbia.edu/faculty/ate11/) proved me very wrong.

Erickson had run across the "partner" label in the 1940 census and asked if I knew anything about its usage. (The specific fascinating case is Erickson's story to tell.) As for me, I had never noticed any "partners" before. (Not that I was looking.)

The instructions to census takers were no help. They mentioned servants and lodgers, but not partners.  Here's what they said:
>A household, as the term is used for census purposes, is a family or any other group of persons living together, with common housekeeping arrangements, in the same living quarters. Although ordinarily a household will consist of a head, his wife, and their children, the persons in a household may or may not be related by blood or marriage. Include a servant, hired hand, or other employee who sleeps in the house as a member of the household for which he or she works. Consider a boarder or lodgers a member of the household with which he lodges, if that is his usual place of residence. (page 37, paragraph 420)

Bureau officials in 1940 assumed a male head of household. I've seen some exceptions, where a wife gets noted down as head and her husband as spouse. The possibility stirred up men's insecurities---at least that's what I take from this 1930 political cartoon:

![1930 Political Cartoon of census taker asking man in an apron if he is married and who the head of the household is.](/images/1930_head_household_cartoon.jpg)
<!---Clipping from *Pittsburgh Press* on 21 March 1930 attached to J.E. Routley, Supervisor, 14th of PA to Acting Director Joseph Hill, 21 March 1930 in Entry 215, “Publicity Materials File of the Statistical Research Division” Box 231 Folder: “E-2 Experiences of 1930 Census Supervisors and Enumerators. Criticisms of Census, Etc.” --->

Reading a bit further, I learned something else of interest. The key to householding (for census takers) was not sex, but cooking. It didn't matter so much who slept with whom, but rather who shared a stove.

>If a married son or daughter or any other person lives in a separate portion of the house that has its own cooking or housekeeping facilities, such persons constitute a household separate... (37, para 421)

If I did find any more partners in census records, the most I could say *with certainty* was: they probably used the same sink.^

[Update: While the handbook for enumerators said nothing of partners, the "Instructions for Filling Out the Population Schedule" did: "If two or more persons not related by blood or by marriage share a common abode as partners, write *head* for one and *partner* for the other or others." Partner was an official category.]

<!--- The above quote is from the back of the "Illustrative Example of Completed Population Schedule" for Alaska. Must check it against quote for continental census and also look at the imagined partners there... -->
<!--- Further confirmation. Found in instructions to field supervisors: "The use of the term 'partner' to specify a second or subsequent unrelated member of the household who is *not* a lodger." on page 4 of Shryock's copy of instructions to be used in morning of second day of "Regional Training Conference for Field Supervisory Personnel" notes dated 21 February 1940 in Folder 7, Box 4, Entry P 15, “Census Planning and Management Files, 1940-1963,” RG 29 NARA I.--->

Turning to statistics from the census, I learned that there were [in fact](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/RELATE#codes_section), **200,152 partners** in the entire census ledgers. That's a number of orders of magnitude greater than "concubine/mistress and children" (105) and about on par with cousins (151,487). But it was **less than one percent (0.74%)** of the number of spouses (effectively "wives").
<!-- All figures derived from the IPUMS variable description for "relate" and the sample "1940 Complete Count"-- see here: https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/RELATE#codes_section -->

Less than one percent of the number of spouses! This did not bode all that well for my quest to discover some more moments when a census taker scribbled "partner" in the bureau-issued portfolio.

Let's do some back of the napkin calculating: (explained after the image, in a manner you might actually be able to read...)

![napkin calculation, explained below](/images/1940-partner-back-o-napkin.jpg)

Each enumerator carries a leather government-issued portfolio, from which they fill out something in the neighborhood of 20 enumeration sheets. Each two-sided sheet fits 80 names.  Most people on the schedule will be heads of household or children, and when we also factor in lodgers and other relatives, spouses end up appearing less than once ever 4 names on a sheet (on average!)

So! We'd^^ expect fewer than 20 spouses on each sheet. That means we'd expect fewer than 400 spouses per enumerator. And so, ta da: we'd expect (400*0.0074=2.96) **fewer than three partners per enumerator**, if every neighborhood was just as likely as any other to be home to partners.

My hunch was: partners would show up more in some places than others, a hunch premised on my prior experience. I had never noticed a "partner" before.

Where? Well, I took a potentially anachronistic gamble and guessed that partners would be more likely to turn up in queer communities.

To begin, I turned to what historian [George Chauncey has written](https://www.amazon.com/Gay-New-York-Culture-1890-1940/dp/0465026214) was considered New York City's "most infamous gay neighborhood by outsiders": Greenwich Village. (227)

<!---George Chauncey: "Gay male residential and commercial enclaves developed in the Bowery, Greenwich Village, Times Square, and Harlem in large part because they were the city's major centers of furnished-room housing for single men. Lesbian enclaves developed for similar reasons in the 1920s in Harlem and the Village, then the city's two primary centers of housing for single women." (136)
on importance of apartments: "Such privacy allowed men to bring gay friends home and allowed couples to live together." (158-159)
"A middle-class gay residential enclave developed on the Upper East Side in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Many gay men moved into the railroad flats in the East Fifties and Sixties east of the Third Avenue elevated train, which allowed them to live close to the elegance of Park Avenue (as well as the gay bars of Third Avenue) at a fraction of the cost. At the same time, a less wealthy gay enclave developed in the Forties west of Eighth Avenue, as large groups of poorer gay men, often youths, crowded into flats in the old tenements of Hell's Kitchen."(159)
"If the Village was considered the city's most infamous gay neighborhood by outsiders, many gay men themselves regarded Harlem as the most exciting center of gay life. In a segregated city, it was the *only* place where black gay men could congregate in commercial establishments, and they were centrally involved in many of the currents of Harlem culture, from the creative literary circles that constituted the Harlem Renaissance to the blues clubs and basements speakeasies where the poorest of Harlem's residents gathered."(227)

"New York's first substantial lesbian enclaves developed in the Village and Harlem at the same time gay male enclaves did."(228)

"Eugene O'Neill's companions in the Village and Provincetown included the noted gay painters Charles Demuth and Marsden Hartley, and, according to O'Neill's biographer Louis Sheaffer, the playwright based Charles Marsden, the effete, implicitly homosexual character in *Strange Interlude*, on them. Margaret Anderson and her masculinely attired lover, Jane Heap, published the influential *Little Review* from the Village, gathering gay and nongay writers around them." --->

Lillian Rita Davis took the census on the block that tracked West 11th Street to West 4th to Perry Street to Bleeker Street. In that little block, her enumeration district (ED) 879, Davis **recorded 12 partners.** Remember, we expected to find 3 at most. My hunch started looking pretty sound.

![map showing enumeration district 879 from originaly 1940 enumeration district maps, overlaid on google maps image.](/images/1940_ED_Greenwich_Village_overlay.jpg)

The very first door that Davis knocked on belonged to two women, both college graduates, originally from Michigan, in their late twenties. Emily Brand worked as a secretary in a theatre company, earning $429 over the course of the year for it. Money must not have determined who got to be labeled "head", since Davis gave Brand that distinction, even though her "partner" Katrina Grant earned $1,330 as a social worker.

![partial enumeration form for Brand and Grant](/images/1940_ED_879_partners.jpg)  

All we can say for sure about Brand and Grant---and the other 11 partnerships that Davis recorded---is that they shared a sink. It seems likely that at least some of these households did live together as lesbian or gay couples. But it could also be that we find so many partnerships in this gay neighborhood, because the presence of queer folk indicated or amplified social and cultural spaces in which people could live openly in odd (that is, unusual), but non-sexual arrangements. The census didn't ask about sexual identity or sexual behavior, and so we cannot know from the census alone.

As for those other partnerships, five partners were women living with another woman, the pairs always within a few years in age. They included a pair of doctors, two travel agents (who may have been business partners, if nothing else), an editor and a secretary, and a secretary and a stenographer who both worked for the YMCA(!). Two of the partners were male-male, including a police detective who lived with a patrolman.

The others are more difficult to parse. There's a cooper (who made liquor barrels) marked as a partner, either to a woman who did insurance accounting or to her brother, an apprenticed electrician. There's a 27-year-old subway track walker, born in Italy, marked as partner, but in whose household I cannot say. Certainly the most intriguing and confusing, is the case of a renowned, divorced psychiatrist, [Viola Bernard](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/archival/collections/ldpd_5420220/), marked down as "partner" in the household of a domestic court judge and her husband, a National Labor Relations Board lawyer, along with their two children. "Partner" helped Davis transform this peculiar (and fascinating) living arrangement into something the census could comprehend.

But Lillian Davis's days of wrestling murky reality into state-approved statistical buckets came to a sudden end when she got a new job ("found employment in private industry" according to a note on one of the sheets) and left the census.
<!--- This according to a note scrawled on ED 31-879, sheet 62B--->
<!---
other partners: at 270 West 11th, three partnerships in a row
-same-sex women: (35&38, college grads, both travel agents--so maybe business parnters too?) (27&27, college grad and one-year college, YMCA secretary and stenographer) (25&26, 2 years and 3 years college, secretary banking and editor publishing) (44&42, high school grads, secretary for liquor company and municipal stenographer) (50&50, each one year of college, both physicians one in general practice and one in bacteriology---the bacteriologist is of some repute: Adele Sheplar)
-same-sex men: (26&25, college grad and 1-year college, insurance salesman and newspaper promoter) (35&34, one-year high school and 3 college, police dept detective and patrolman!!)
-unclear: (listed as partner, in household where head is a 28yo woman living with 25yo brother; partner is 27--she is insurance bookkeeper, brother is apprentice electrician and partner is cooper in "liquors"--not entirely clear if partner actually belongs to this household); ( 270 male partner from Italy has 5y elementary education and is trackwalker for IRT subway--OR: at 270 W 4th, not clear who partner is) (viola bernard is 32yo divorced college grad and doctor at psychiatric institute, marked as parter, living with head who is 34yo NLRB lawyer and his 36yo wife who is domestic court judge (Shad and Justine Polier), along with their son, an adopted daughter, and a maid -- what a household!) (36 y/o ladieswear clerk with a year of high school -- the final "partner" may not be propertly labeled or coded---it's unclear who the head is...)
--->

Davis's adventures in enumerating made a good case for---at the very least---linking "partners" to gay and lesbian neighborhoods.

Patrena Greco's census schedules make me more confident that Davis' block wasn't a fluke. Looking back to Chauncey's *Gay New York*, I read:
>A middle-class gay residential enclave developed on the Upper East Side in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. Many gay men moved into the railroad flats in the East Fifties and Sixties east of the Third Avenue elevated train, which allowed them to live close to the elegance of Park Avenue (as well as the gay bars of Third Avenue) at a fraction of the cost. (159)

Enumeration district 1272 lay smack in the middle of that developing gay enclave. That's where Greco went counting, and that's where Greco recorded **13 partners**---quite a few more than the 3 we^^ expected. **But the census stories of the partners of the Upper East Side, will have to wait for another time...**

^[The folks at the Minnesota Population Center, who maintain the invaluable Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), explain](https://usa.ipums.org/usa-action/variables/RELATE#comparability_section): "Before 1960, the category 'partner' refers to a non-relative who shares the home and expenses with the head, including responses such as co-head and business partner."

^^Those who are grammar aware, may note here that I've switched out of the first person. I'm employing instead the statistical 'we,' a we that abides in a world where it's possible to have 2.5 kids.
