**After a brief hiatus, the Census Stories are back! Expect new stories appearing regularly, very soon!**

[I'm Dan Bouk](http://www.colgate.edu/facultysearch/facultydirectory/dbouk) and I am writing a book called *Stories from the Inventory*. It's about the stories that census records can tell about Americans, their families, and the nation. It is about learning to read data in a new way, almost the way one reads a novel, or learns to interpret architecture.

On this blog, I'm sharing some of my discoveries as I go.

I enjoy most explaining how institutions and practices that look boring, actually work to reshape our lives. That's what motivated my first book: [*How Our Days Became Numbered*, now in paperback!](https://www.amazon.com/How-Our-Days-Became-Numbered/dp/022656486X/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=)

Can't wait to learn more about the census? The best place to start is [this book](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300195422/american-census) by historian Margo Anderson!
