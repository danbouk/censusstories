[I'm Dan Bouk](http://www.colgate.edu/facultysearch/facultydirectory/dbouk) and I am writing a book about the 1940 U.S. census. But first, I'm sharing some of the stories I am encountering along the way.

I enjoy most explaining how institutions and practices that look boring, actually work to reshape our lives. That's what motivated my first book: [*How Our Days Became Numbered*, now in paperback!](https://www.amazon.com/How-Our-Days-Became-Numbered/dp/022656486X/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=).
