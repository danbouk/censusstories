Hello: Thanks for visiting *CensusStories.US*! This site is MOSTLY RETIRED. For new stuff, come visit me at [SHROUDED IN CLOAKS OF BORINGNESS](https://www.shroudedincloaksofboringness.com/), a blog.

If you want to be alerted right away as I tell the stories of power, politics, meaning, and identity that hide within and behind bureaucracies, budgets, censuses, and all sorts of public and private numbers, then please sign up for my e-mail newsletter! (I promise, it is sent with just the right infrequency.)

In the meantime, I'm leaving Census Stories, USA here those teachers who still use these stories in their classrooms.

About me:

[I'm Dan Bouk](http://www.colgate.edu/facultysearch/facultydirectory/dbouk). I maintained this blog while writing a book called *Democracy's Data: The Hidden Stories in the U.S. Census and How to Read Them*.

I enjoy most explaining how institutions and practices that look boring, actually work to reshape our lives. That's what motivated my first book: [*How Our Days Became Numbered*, now in paperback!](https://www.amazon.com/How-Our-Days-Became-Numbered/dp/022656486X/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=)

Can't wait to learn more about the census? The best place to start is [this book](https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300195422/american-census) by historian Margo Anderson!
