U.S. Department of Commerce, *Annual Report* (1921) "Appendix B.--Abstract of Report of the Director of the Bureau of the Census"

From Hoover's annual report, an appendix titled "Abstract of Report of the Director of the Bureau of the Census" and noting William M. Steuart as census director -- so authorship is quite murky here: could be Hoover or Steuart, or someone else entirely...
 describing how massive a job the census is:

having discussed the difficulties involved in getting the census done and reports completed within the allotted three years of the census period:
"It is, however, by no means a simple matter, easy of accomplishment; and probably few persons other than those connected with the census realize the magnitude of the undertaking and the difficulties of carrying it to completion within the period prescribed by law. It involves the printing and distribution of 18,000,000 schedules of questions; the organization and supervision of a force of over 90,000 enumerators and special agents employed to make a house-to-house canvass of the entire United States--including all the outlying possessions except the Philippines and the Virgin Islands--and to fill out schedules for 107,500,000 people, 6,500,000 farms, and 450,000 manufacturing establishments; the punching of 300,000,000 tabulation cards; the running of the equivalent of over 2,000,000,000 cards through electrical sorting and tabulating machines; the computation of several million percentages; the preparation of elaborate manuscript tables; and, finally, the printing and publication of 11 quarto volumes of about 1,000 pages each.
"The enumeration of population and the collection of the statistics of agriculture and manufactures for the Fourteenth Census gave employment to a field force of 94,140 supervisors, enumerators, special agents, and clerks. Virtually this entire force was selected, instructed, and organized, completed its work, and was paid and disbanded within 12 months. The expenditures for field work amounted to $11,479,390.
"As the field work approached completion the office force was augmented, the peak being reached on August 31, 1920, when there were 6,301 employees, including statisticians, clerks, and machine operatives at work in the Bureau. This force was engaged in the examination and tabulation of the returns and in the preparation of the bulletins and reports.
"The population of Continental United States, as reported for the census of 1920, was 105,710, 620, an increase of 13,738,354 over the population in 1910. This increase in population was accompanied by increases in manufactures and agriculture, which added materially to the magnitude and complexity of the census work. The increase in the office work has been cared for by a larger number of clerks than at prior censuses, and also by the introduction of improved methods and the more general use of machinery." (40-41)

"It required 301,255,417 punched cards to record for tabulation all the data obtained by the census, and in order to produce the various combinations and classifications of the statistics it was necessary for the cards to pass through the various machines more than once--in many instances 16 times. This machine work represents, therefore, the passage of the equivalent of 2,022,601,850 cards through the various sorting and tabulating machines." (42)

"The work on population and vital statistics required 35 high-speed electric tabulators, capable of operating at the rate of 400 cards per minute and recording 60 items at a time on each card. These are owned by the Census Bureau. In addition, the Bureau has rented from the Tabulating Machine Co. 79 sorting and 78 tabulating machines: has rented, purchased, or constructed 1,544 card-punching machines; and has purchased 122 adding and calculating machines to supplement the 152 already owned, to say nothing of the large number it has been necessary to rent from time to time. Many of the machines have been in operation on two shifts, day and night. With this equipment the Bureau was able to make much more rapid progress in the tabulation of the data than at any preceding census." (43)
