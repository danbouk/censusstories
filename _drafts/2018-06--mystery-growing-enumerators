post this after the piece on not paying the enumerators, which should set up a sense of how many people we're talking about

talk about sampling and quote about the revolution of 1940

talk Moneyball and death of the scout talk

then show table of enumerator numbers from Census website

figure out why?...

come back to Moneyball, to Nate Silver on scouts?
