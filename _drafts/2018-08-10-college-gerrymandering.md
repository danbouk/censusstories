open w/ prison Gerrymandering and ref citylab cartoon

credit Petrulis for raising the issue

What do I have? There are only 6 lines where people are counted living in the college... Should I compare this with another place? (maybe to Fisk? to Princeton, to E. Lansing)

<!---
possible college students in Hamilton---looking for people who are listed as having moved in last 5 years and who are also coded as a student...

E.D. No. 27-18, Hamilton, NY Sheet 9A, lines 24 and 25: at 5 W. Kendrick there is Sheldon Giles, white male 25 yo listed as C-4, previously for Sydney, Delaware County, NY and married to Margaret Giles, white female 24yo with c-3 now housekeeping from Roxbury NY

Indeed there is a Sheldon Elmore Guile listed on page 57 of Salmagundi whose address is given as 5 West Kendrick--Salmagundi lists range of clubs from debate to Colgate Christian Association and he majored in history and politics

But I cannot find any other students in this enumeration...they seem to all be elsewhere...

Salmagundi (page 56) lists William Kennedy Goodspeed at 10 University Ave in Hamilton, but he's not in these lists (where is he?)

ah Salmagundi (page 84) lists Kermit Briggs Streeter at 43 Payne Street and indeed he's there and looks like he grew up in town, with two parents who were clerks at a Five and Dime store

only from senior class---still need to look at others...

compare Colgate with Attica, or the prison where Andy teaches?? [maybe in successive, paired posts?---Mohawk Correctional Facility in Herkimer County]

figure out if college kids are often double counted--look at Colgate? look at East Lansing and Princeton?

Bureau of the Census, *Instructions to Enumerators: Population and Agriculture 1940* Form PA-1 (Washington, D.C., 1940).

Another example of an economic definition over a familial one: "Enumerate such persons as residents of the district in which they sleep during their work periods. For example, a person who works and sleeps in Chicago during the week should be enumerated as a resident of Chicago, even though he stays with his parents in Milwaukee each week end. However, enumerate persons with no fixed place of work, such as traveling salesmen, railroad trainmen, porters, etc. (see par. 324), as residents of the district in which their families live, even though most of the time they sleep away from the family residence." (14, para. 303) [did this approach change over time? Note this means I would be listed as Hamilton residence and not NYC, despite legal residency]

"Persons to be counted as members of the household include the following:
a. Members of the household temporarily absent at the time of the enumeration, either in foreign countries or elsewhere in the United States, on business or visiting.
b. Members of the household attending schools or colleges located in other districts, except student nurses away from home and students in the Naval Academy at Annapolis, or in the Military Academy at West Point, or in any other training school or institution operated by the War or the Navy Departments or the United States Coast Guard.
c. Members of the household who are in a hospital or a sanitarium but who are expected to return in a short period of time.
d. Servants or other employees who live with the household or sleep in the same dwelling.
e. Boarders or lodgers who sleep in the house.
f. Members of the household enrolled in the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)." (15, para. 306) [why exclude nurses and military academies??? while including CCC folk]

generally do not enumerate visitors from abroad, but: "(Enumerate other persons from abroad who are *students in this country* or who are *employed here*, however, even though they do not expect to remain here permanently.)" (16, para 313d)

also do not enumerate: "Students or children living or boarding with this household in order to attend some school, college, or other educational institution in the locality, but who have a usual place of residence elsewhere from which they will be reported." (16-17, para 313e)

do not enumerate: "Persons who were formerly members of this household, but have since become inmates of a jail; or a mental institution, home for the aged, infirm or needy, reformatory, prison, or any other institution in which inmates may remain for long periods of time." (17, para 313h)

do not enumerate: "Transient patients of hospitals or sanitariums. Such patients are to be enumerated as residents in the households of which they are members and not as residents in the institution, unless they have no other place of residence at which they will be reported." (17, para 313i)

under "**Enumeration of Special Classes of Persons**" (17) we find: Servants; Boarders and Lodgers; Students at School or College; School Teachers; Student Nurses; Patients in Hospitals, Sanitariums, and Convalescent Homes; Inmates of Prisons, Asylums, and Institutions Other than Hospitals; Persons in Construction and Other Camps; Persons Engaged in Railway Services or Traveling; Persons in Tourist or Trailer Camps; Soldiers, Sailors, and Marines; Persons in Civilian Conservation Corps Camps; Officers on Merchant Vessels; Crews of Merchant Vessels; Citizens Abroad at the Time of the Enumeration; Diplomatic and Consular Employees of Foreign Governments (17-20)

"318. **Students at School or College.**---If there is a school, college, or other educational institution in your district which has students from outside your district, enumerate as residents of the school only those students who have no usual places of residence elsewhere. Especially in a university or professional school there will be a considerable number of the older students who are not members of any household located elsewhere. Find and enumerate all such persons." (18, para 318) [what a PHRASE: FIND AND ENUMERATE !!!]

"319. **School Teachers.**---Enumerate teachers in a school or college at the place where they live while engaged in teaching, even though they may spend the summer vacation at their parents' home or elsewhere." (18, pare 319)

"320. **Student Nurses.**---Enumerate student nurses as residents of the hospital, nurses' home, or other place in which they live while they are receiving their training." (18, para. 320)

"322. **Inmates of Prisons, Asylums, and Institutions Other Than Hospitals**---Your district may include a prison, reformatory, or jail, a home for orphans, for aged, inform or needy persons, for blind, deaf, or incurable persons, a soldiers' home, an asylum or hospital for the insane or feeble-minded, or a similar institution in which inmates usually remain for long periods of time. Enumerate *all* the inmates of such institutions at the institutions. Note that in the case of jails you must enumerate the prisoners there, however short the sentence." [I wonder if this could ever be rigged, to time sentencing to pump up numbers?]

"410. **Name of Institution.**---If you are enumerating the population of an institution, no matter how small, such as a prison, jail, almshouse, or asylum, enter the full name of the institution in the place indicated at the head of the schedule. If the name of the institution does not indicate its type, enter also the type of institution as 'John Smith Home (Home for the Aged).' In case only a portion of a sheet of the Population schedule is used for inmates of the institution, indicate the lines on which the names of the inmates appear, as 'Marshall County Jail, lines 25 to 69.'" (35, para 410)

"427. **Institutional Households.**---The officials, employees, and inmates of an institution who live in the institution building or buildings make up one household. But if any officer or employee and his family, if any, live in separate quarters (a detached house or structure containing no inmates), they should be returned as a separate household." (38, para 427)

"449. Occupants of an institution, prison, school, etc., living in the institutional building or buildings, should be designated as *officer*, *inmate*, *patient*, *pupil*, etc.; and in the case of the chief officer, his title should be used as *superintendent, warden, principal*, etc., instead of the word 'Head.' Enter the prisoner's number in col. 8 for an inmate of a penal institution that identifies its prisoners by number; enter 'prisoner' for a prisoner not identified by number."

"469. Enter C-1 to C-5, for a person who completed 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 or more years at a college or university or a professional school (law, medical school, dental school, normal school, engineering school, or theological school), whether or not the person graduated from high school." (46, para 469)

for economic questions on work status on March 24-30, 1940, talking about labor force: "494. *Persons not in the labor force* March 24-30 will include all other persons 14 years old or over, that is those not working, not assigned to public emergency work, not seeking work, and with a job, business, or professional enterprise....persons in school ('S' in col. 25)... " (50, para 494)
