the point of this piece would be to show off some of the pictures of the new machines, which have been a center of much of the census story

but don't write off and even emphasize the extent to which the census was a key institution shaping the history of computing (like DARPA but less sexy)

but then instead focus on the census as a human machine, as emblematic of new forms of labor, of the rise of offices, of feminized mechanical labor, and auguring algorithmic unemployment too

get toward the idea that a nation can be ruled from an office building
