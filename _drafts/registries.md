“It occurs to me that we should have a story about the registration of aliens as a Current Item in the October issue of Population Index. Such a story should I think indicate the purposes of the registration, something of its machinery, and the nature of the data being collected, and should be angled at its implications for the development of future population registers in this country. If it is not too much trouble I would greatly appreciate your sending me the available materials on which such a story could be based.”

" Based on a close reading of internal Department of Commerce documents tied to the census citizen question proposal, it appears the Trump administration wants to use the census to construct a first-of-its-kind citizenship registry for the entire U.S. population — a decision that arguably exceeds the legal authority of the census." [BUT: maybe DON'T LINK to this b/c this guy doesn't seem like the greatest scholar, and was not too generous in citing Margo Anderson, et al.]
