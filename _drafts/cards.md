SAY WHAT YOU MEAN BOUK

awesome and awful -- awe-filled, awe-inspiring -- the power of rationality and rationalizing

do something with the formal simularity of the office building, the boxes, the schedule, and the punch cards: all stacks and rows...maybe the city grid too

use image of all the boxes

1939: Space for Clerical Force:
“The Bureau is now six months behind in securing absolutely essential space. The Woodward and Lothrop warehouse building will be ready for our occupancy at the end of this week or early next week. It will house our division of Geography and our Field Division. Your attention, however, is called to the delay by the Treasury Department in beginning the construction of the Federal building at 2nd and 3rd Streets, D Street and Virginia Avenue, S.W. The appropriation was approved on March 15, 1939. This building must be completed by the end of the present calendar year and turned over to the Bureau of the Census for occupancy on January 3, 1940. The construction has not yet started. Further delay in securing necessary space will probably be fatal to the success of the 1940 census, with the time period given us by law and the amount of the appropriation made by the Congress.”

caption in pencil says 1939 architectural drawing
typed caption reads: "This new six-story building will house the approximately 7,000 clerks needed to compile the returns of the 1940 census. Population, housing, agriculture, irrigation and drainage, business, manufacturing and mines and quarries will be covered in this census which is the sixteenth time a national census has been taken since the first one in 1790."

also talk about census work as a kind of light industry--think about all those clerks and machines too--it's not just a metaphorical factory for knowledge (but we tend to erase the real infrastructure---just as we do in imagining away the internet's physicality)


1941: “Because of the recent changes, the personnel of the Division is now housed in four different locations. In the Commerce Building, the Acting Chief Statistician and several offices are located on the fifth floor, and the Negro Statistics section on the third floor. In the Census Building, the Acting Assistant Chief Statistician and the bulk of the technical personnel are located on the fourth floor, east wing, and Mr. Beales and the Statistical Abstract section are located in the central wing of the fourth floor.” (4) [FOUDRAY prob in 4th floor Census building]
