from census supervisors:


Hardin-- husband supervisor and wife enumerator

John H. Hammer is supervisor (87-5) -- he is married, but wife not there -- lodger Ethyl Dowdell is state director WPA Professional and Service Division--living away from family
she is mentioned here, in relation to film or radio work: https://books.google.com/books?id=6qrBAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PA114&ots=c6dkFXJ5Qv&dq=ethyl%20m%20dowdel%20south%20dakota&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q=ethyl%20m%20dowdel%20south%20dakota&f=false


Harney lives in Spencer Arms hotel amongst other lodgers, perhaps

Hogan L. Yancey lives as boarder, away from his family... (he is listed as single; wife is marked as divorced: is this actually standard practice---do only wives get smeared as divorced)


(Ethan also found a convent...unrelated...)
