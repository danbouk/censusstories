from Anderson, *The American Census* second edition: notes Public-Law 94-521, the Mid-Decade Census Act, and says it revised Title 13 (from 1954) "specifying that the census results be reported for apportionment nine months from Census Day and that the bureau would provide a report to congressional oversight committees on the subjects of the decennial census three years before Census Day and the actual questions two years before Census Day. The act also clarified and strengthened the confidentiality protections of census microdata by removing language that gave the secretary of commerce discretion to release individual-level data for 'proper purposes.'"

1921 JANUARY House report 1173
on Jan. 8
Committee of Census report favors HR 14498
483 member house
all states gain; none lose
major fractions, and no other serious option (mentions "method of 1850")
advocates constitutional amendment to limit house to 500
argument for more reps b/c women voting and lots of ex-soldiers to look after
Tinkham of MA argues for reducing reps b/c of disenfranchised in South, per 14th amendment
but committee says they can't do it; not quickly enough...
just over 60,000 Indians not taxed

MINORITY REPORT:
want to stay at 435, arguing against costs of expanding out, also arguing against a constitutional amendment


---
[Vandenberg in 1928 claims that the house passed a bill on 19 January 1921---what bill is that? this report took place on 8 January 1921, but did this one pass? the July report claims that a bill at 435 passed in the 66th congress...?]
it was a bill for 435! according newspapers, and the Plains states immediately cried foul, saying the count was flawed...

according to Margo Anderson, Huntington writes to Congress and NYT--she cites NYT letter from 16 Jan 1921

no word on House passing and Senate killing it...put Anderson notes that they recess in March 1921

next hearings not until 1925-1926, and Anderson says its the Census Committee where it keeps getting stuck...

1921 JULY House Report 312
on H.R. 7882
460 members
Maine and Missouri each lose 1 seat
mention methods: "Wilcox"/"Cornell" vs. "Huntington"/"Harvard"
but the methods agree at 460 (is that why chosen?)
citizenship and birthplace of foreign-born white data appended to report
"Those of us who have studied the census of 1920 know that the majority of our people are now living in the cities. How to encourage the rising generation to actively engage in agriculture is one of the big problems which must be faced."(3)
includes provision to force redistricting in a state that loses representatives; a new concern
argues that ex-soldiers need more representatives, that the existing buildings would suffice to hold everyone, that it is false economy to limit the size, that the spirit of representation favors more direct representation, and the size of the house and ratio of reps to represented is actually pretty high compared to other nations

MINORITY REPORT:
"The House of Representatives in the Sixty-sixth Congress, by a vote of 267 to 76, passed a bill fixing the membership of the House under the census of 1920 at 435." (35) [not sure what referring to...]
mostly arguments about cost and efficiency
but also arguing that guaranteeing each state, and even slow growing states, that they would not lose a rep was bad policy and only really a general policy since 1880
the house has to stop growing at some point...

SPECIAL DISSENT by John J. McSwain: long argument about why it really is not good that Congress is claiming the power to declare how a state should be redistricted if it does not do it itself

1926 (Feb. 25) discussing HR 111
Rankin has shown up now--and he's calling established norms into question

from Rankin 1940 Reapportionment, at image 74
Jones to FDR, 29 November 1940
Jones is Secry of Commerce now
"Transmitted herewith is a memorandum from the Director of the Census enclosing a tabulation giving the population of each State on April 1, 1940 as ascertained under the Sixteenth Decennial Census of the United States. This tabulation was prepared in compliance with the provisions of section 2 of the Act of June 18, 1929 under which the Sixteenth Decennial Census was taken. The tabulation also gives the number of Representatives to which each State will be entitled if the present number of Representatives (435) are apportioned by the method of major fractions, which was the method used in the last preceding apportionment, and also by the method of equal proportions."
"The tabulation of total population of States for purposes of apportionment does not show any 'Indians not taxed' as all Indians are now subject to Federal taxation."
"You will recall that by the provisions of section 22 of the Decennial Census Act of June 18, 1929, as amended by the Act of April 25, 1940, the President is required to transmit this information to the 77th Congress during the first week of the first regular session."
I LOVE "You will recall" here also significant is "this information"--and this is all in RANKIN's papers, so it certainly public
