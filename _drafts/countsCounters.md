on counting Hoover as publicity stunt
<!-- photo of J. Sterlin Moran, who enumerated Hoover, with his secretary Frances Harrington from clipping from a 1930 Charleston newspaper in Entry 215, “Publicity Materials File of the Statistical Research Division” Box 231 Folder “E-2 Experiences of 1930 Census Supervisors and Enumerators. Criticisms of Census, Etc.” -->
where was Hoover in 1940

do Moran and Harrington... (this can be a short post)
