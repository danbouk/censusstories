Jacob Riis's lantern slides (a projection technology) portrayed: [list] His images still dominate our historical imagination of the New York 'tenement' at the end of the nineteenth century and beyond.

While Riis stalked the Lower East Side capturing the (staged) banalities of ordinary life, census takers went about a much more systematic inquiry into the lives of apartment dwellers. Having explained to census takers in 1890 that a "dwelling-house" could range from a single family home to a "a room above a warehouse or factory, a loft above a stable, a wigwam on the outskirts of a settlement," [officials emphasized](https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/programs-surveys/decennial/technical-documentation/questionnaires/1890instructions.pdf) that "a tenement house, whether it contains two, three, or forty families should be considered for the purposes of the census as one house."(19)

census stats here on the number of tenements?

In *How the Other Half Lives*, Riis relied on government statistics in concert with his slides to paint a disturbing picture. America's great cities had caught up, he said, with the fate they had long postponed. Blaming greedy speculators taking advantage of lesser (especially easter and southern European)races, Riis despaired that by 1890 three-quarters of all of New York City's people lived in tenements, and from those tenements emerged a new class of criminals at the head of "a standing army of ten thousand tramps."(3)

By 1920, the U.S. Census Bureau declared that the entire nation had tipped from mainly rural to mainly urban. [more here] (Of course, definitions matter: the bureau said any place with a population exceeding 2,500 people counted as urban. That, therefore, would include the three-stop-light town where I teach, which I assure you dear reader has never been accused of being urban.)



[eventually compare red-line maps to Sanford maps to Hull House maps; or think about the way the 1940s photography walked off to the rural west, but the census did not...]

accomany Kenn and stroll through Furedi's building and the people who live there... (talking about enumerator instructions)...can link back to this post talking about race/ethnicity etc.
