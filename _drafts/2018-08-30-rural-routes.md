Foudray not enumerated until 4 June which I can now contextualize: in month of June the final fifth of all enumerators finished up, leaving only 1,000 still working in July
<!--- Field Division, Bureau of the Census, “Rough Draft: Historical Report of 1940 (16th Decennial) Census Made from the Records that Were Available in 1948 with Emphasis on the Field Aspects” (1948), 25, Folder “16th Decennial Census 1940—Historical Report of 1940 Census” Box 2, Entry P 26 “Scrapbooks 1940 Census of Housing,” NARA I--->

NO: this is should be a later post, thinking about the end of the enumeration...
make this about Alaska too? Or one place to start the Alaska story?... (about scale--how early it starts and how long it goes...)--or maybe an Alaska post could be coupled with this post devoted to sussing out the census laggards...

(Alaska post should be about Kennecott!!!—working from Cronon piece too)
