On the second of May, 1940, an enumerator named Edward W. Davenport interviewed Clare Duter, a homemaker with a high school education and two sons aged 6 and 4. Duter reported that her husband Ralph worked--like the enumerator--for the census, but his job was different. Davenport recorded his job as "photographer."

What did it mean to be a census photographer? It may be that Duter took publicity shots for census advertising campaigns, or documentary photographs of the bureau's machines--I have plenty of evidence that such photographs existed, but none with Duter recognized as the author. Instead, Duter shows up in the historical record--in the *Washington Post* in fact--as a micro-photographer: he took pictures on microfilm of aging census records. Those photos are the means by which census records come to most Americans. Duter, or one of his successors, eventually made such a photograph of his own 1940 census record. And decades later a scanner digitized those microfilm reels, creating jpegs like the one above.

“Not always has the census been such a machine-age process as it has been in 1940. In ‘olden times’ the enumerators wrote in large books. Ralph W. Duter here is using the micro-film camera to photograph old records to prevent the wear and tear of constant handling.” (VII:3)
