Joseph J. Salvo, "Local Involvement in Census Taking" in *Encyclopedia of the U.S. Census: From the Constitution to the American Community Survey (ACS)* eds. Margo J. Anderson, Constance F. Citro, and Joseph J. Salvo (Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2011): 302-305.

the article is understandably focused on the modern era and lots of the big interventions in local efforts to improve accuracy and in creating new small area data are post-1960 developments. But 1940 is a key turning point year too both for the formalized undercount (replacing earlier complaints by individual cities) and for the CB taking over the direction of the tract program

"These complaints sometimes resulted in a recheck of the census enumeration, which did sometimes result in higher counts, as was the case in New York City, Philadelphia, and Indianapolis in 1870."(303)

"In Minneapolis and Saint Paul, for example, allegations that schedules were lost in the 1890 census resulted in a re-enumeration that revealed widespread fraud by census enumerators who had attempted to boost population counts." (303)

"Civic involvement in census taking became more formalized in the twentieth century, with the advent of local-area census committees and increased awareness of the decennial census as a planning tool." (303)

Tacoma, WA recount in 1910 decreases from 116,000 to 84,000 (303)

"Declines in mailback response with each passing decade prompted the bureau to form local committees, composed of influential government officials and community leaders, to plan and implement local publicity and outreach campaigns. According to the Census Bureau, about 9,800 of the 39,000 local governments responded to the call for Complete Count Committees in 1990, with some 5,600 actually participating in the program."(303)

"The local review program began in 1980, when local governments were permitted to review housing unit counts before they became final so that deficits in the enumeration could be identified....The idea was to incorporate local knowledge and data to make the address list used in the enumeration more accurate before the census itself was taken (pre-census local review) and to review the preliminary housing unit counts from the actual enumeration before they became final so that problems in the field could be identified and fixed (post-census local review). The local government was given a limited period (usually 30 to 60 days) to respond with challenges based on local data." (303)

"Congress passed the Address List Improvement Act in 1994, which permitted local governments to receive and review the actual address list..." (303)
LUCA = Local Update of Census Addresses

"Some 8,100 governments, or about 21 percent of all those eligible to participate in the 2010 LUCA program, submitted address information."(303)

"Groups such as the New York Federation of Churches and the New York City 1920 Census Committee designed the small-area tabulations that later became the foundation for the census tract program, as adopted by the Census Bureau in 1940. Until that time, the program was funded by local entities in New York, Cleveland, and other cities that found the information essential for addressing problems in their rapidly growing communities." (304)

"When the new era of federal funding began in the 1960s and 1970s, involvement in this program peaked because small-area data were now being used to allocate funds for a variety of purposes, including community-development initiatives." (305)

"The most recent effort by the Census Bureau to solicit input on small-area geography for 2010 is called the Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP), in which local participants are permitted to redefine small geographic areas for data-reporting purposes, based on thresholds established by the Census Bureau."(305)

"The size of the areas for which data are available range from as large as the United States as a whole to as small as a city block. Many different types of geographic areas lie in between." (377)

types of geographies: political, statistical, administrative (377)

"For many users and applications, the published geographic areas are sufficient. In other cases, users need to aggregate the published geography so that they can use data for user-defined geographic areas." (377)

counties cover everything; and ~1/2 states have "minor civil divisions (MCDs)" or "county subdivisions" for census and then census creates "census county divisions [CCDs]" for the other states w/o MCDs. part of the key thing to note here is just how different political histories in states have created different kinds of local government organization (377)

then incorporated places and CDPs (census designated places)

political districts and elections areas are NOT considered political geographies b/c not actually governance units

STAT geo: "Statistical geography is entirely within the control of the Census Bureau or of the intermediaries who create these types of geographic areas for local use." (378)

tracts: "The census tract program was extended nationwide for publication of 2000 census data"

"Census tracts are important in and of themselves (that is, to view data for a small area),  but they are equally important as building blocks for administrative and service geography." (378)

"Block groups are designed to have about 400 housing units and population of 1,000, but many vary significantly from that ideal." (378)

"A census block is, strictly speaking, not statistical geography. It describes a physical area, bounded by visible features such as streets, railroads, and water...Because most blocks have small population and housing unit counts, only 100 percent data, or short-form data, are tabulated for them." (378)

"As with block groups, the primary use of block data is as building blocks to other geography, especially voting precincts. Block data have also served an important function as the source of housing unit counts for sampling frames used in local surveys." (378)

Joseph J. Salvo, "Census Tracts" in *Encyclopedia of the U.S. Census: From the Constitution to the American Community Survey (ACS)* eds. Margo J. Anderson, Constance F. Citro, and Joseph J. Salvo (Washington, D.C.: CQ Press, 2011): 82-84.

Salvo's story makes clear that the creation of seemingly abstract statistical geographies still required local knowledge, local politics and money, and a bottom-up approach--this new level of abstraction wasn't an imposition, but it was an alternative to the local political system or a sign of how politics was changing

"Census tracts are intended to permit meaningful analyses of small areas over time and, as such, have  relatively permanent boundaries." (82) [TIME SERIES!]

begins with Walter Laidlaw, director of Population Research Bureau of the New York Federation of Churches: "Laidlaw argued for a permanent geography not susceptible to the political manipulation of wards and assembly districts. He advocated a scientific map system, one capable of fitting addresses to new statistical areas that were small and similar in physical size with permanent boundaries that provided for comparisons from one census to another." (82) [sounds like a Progressive, of the efficiency over politics variety, and maybe distrustful of the machines?]

in 1907, goes to DC, gets for 1910: tracts in the punch cards -- "Eight cities would have census tract codes for 1910, but local organizations would have to supply funds and labor for the actual compilation and presentation of data." (82)

"the 1910 census tracts were adopted by the New York City Department of Health as 'sanitary districts,' in an effort to monitor public health." (82)

Howard Whipple Green, a statistician seeking to study movement of blacks in Cleveland, and who "also heard laments of the Cleveland Health Council about problems posed by the absence of base data from which to calculate mortality and morbidity rates over time for neighborhoods." (83) -- gets *Chicago Plain Dealer* to ante up funds, seeing tracts as source of market data -- becomes chair of ASA Committee on Census Enumeration Areas in 1931 -- and now Salvo is talking about "a census tract movement" (83)

"In 1940 the bureau, for the first time, coded and published census tract bulletins for 64 cities. The formal program that was created was based on a unique foundation of unprecedented federal-local cooperation. The task of delineating tracts and monitoring their boundaries from decade to decade was to be the work of local census tract committees, functioning in concert with Bureau of the Census geographers." (83)

"Local committees also encouraged organizations to code their administrative records by census tract, originally through the use of locally prepared address coding guides and, more recently, through geographic information systems that permit electronic geocoding." (83)

"Although tracts are designed to be homogeneous from the standpoint of social, economic, and housing conditions when first delineated, there is little guarantee that this will continue over time, especially in areas with high population turnover." (83)

look into Laidlaw and Green, and their pubs?

Nancy Krieger on the moral of tract:
*Journal of Urban Health*
"the census tract can achieve its objective precisely because it is a national creation of democratic governance informed by local input, in accord with uniform standards, rather than driven by the imperatives of short-term political gain (per the prior use of wards to tally populations) or market distortions."
similar to Salvo read on Laidlaw; but that distrust of the parties could stand some questioning...was it also about distrust of machines and immigrants?

Walter Laidlaw, *A Sketchy History of the Census Tract System of New York City, and an Account of the (1935) Expansion of its Census Tract Maps into Census Tract Block Maps* (New York, 1935)

on title page: "work executed March 6, 1934-July 19, 1935. Reported as at May 1, 1935 in report commenced April 17, 1935 for Mr. Walter F. Howes, Mayor's Committee on City Planning, 902 Broadway, New York City"
Laidlaw listed as "Supervisor Borough Census Tract Block Maps"

on tracts since 1910: "originated by the writer, in 1906, in an article published by The New York Federation of Churches, entitled "The Need of a Permanent Map System for the Scientific Study of the Population of New York City." (1)

the problem before tracts, could allow cross census comparisons at County level, but the 1910 census: "would furnish no information for comparing, in  1910, with 1900, the populations of any  comparable subdivisions of these boroughs, or, in other words, could furnish no information of the movement of population wihtin borough boundaries, for the reason that the tabulation units of 1900 were the assembly districts constituted in 1894, thourgh the State Census of 1892, whereas the assembly districts of 1910 would follow the changed boundaries of assembly districts to be constituted through the State Census of 1905."(1)
"Actually, in 1907, 63 assembly districts were set up within  the limits of Greater New York, none of them coterminous with an assembly district in existence in 1900."(1)

"The Constitutional Convention  of 1894 divided the counties consolidated into a single city in 1898 into 60 assembly districts; Chapter 727, Laws of 1907, increased their number to 63; Chapter 778, Laws of 1917, decreased them to 62; and the Legislature of the State of New York, today adjourning, has not succeeded in changing the boundaries adopted in 1917."(2)

"The apportionment opposed by Tammany Hall in the Legislature of 1935 appears in the last column."(2)

paragraph torn, but appears to be saying the thing is the census keeps geo permanent to show movements of population, while assembly districts have to move and shift, since their purpose is to create "periodically, areas of reasonably equalized citizen..."(2)

originally suggested  tract of 160 acres, interested especially in population density (3)
"The Tenement House Department, however, desired a unit smaller than 160 acres for typically tenement house areas, and a 40 acre unit, approximately, was agreed for them, to be uniformly extended to the whole city." (3)

"The Tenement House Department,  itself, for the 1910 Census, drew the boundaries of 415 tenement districts, averaging about 40 acres each, which were identically followed in the Censuses of 1920 and 1930."(3)
"293 Tracts of the Census of 1910, ranging from nearly 80 acres to over 5,000 acres in area, were subdivided for the 1920 census, at the request of the Department of Health, through COmmissioner Emerson, in 1915, into 3,012 units, making a total, in 1910, of 708, and in 1920 of 3,427 tract units on a map accepted by the Census Bureau in 1918, and later superimposed on Board of Estimate section maps which were furnished the Federal Census Bureau by the Population Research Bureau of the Federation of Churches, through the writer, then in charge of that Bureau."(3)
"He also had charge, as editor, of reports on the detailed tract populations of 1910 and 1920, published by the Federation of Churches and the New York City 1920 Census Committee,--reincorporated,  1924, as the Cities Census Committee, and in 1932 merged with the Research Division of the Welfare Council of New York." (3)

Laidlaw claiming expert knowledge of NYC tracts, pop stats, and "the permanent 'statistical areas', made of groupings of census tracts, designed by him, which have displaced, at his suggestion, unusable, (because periodically changing), assembly districts, as Federal Census units, for publication by it of the details of population in subdivisions of borough areas." (4)

"The writer is familiar  also with the  uses of the census tract  system by city  departments, including, most typically, the  Department of Health, whose adoptoin  of the census tracts of 1910 for statistical calculations, and maps, gave them popularly, for  some time, th title of 'sanitary districts', and the Board of Transportation, which  superimposed  th ecity's transit system on  the  35 Board of Estimate maps, which were the base of the tract maps of 1920-1930, in a publication of  January 1,  1931, entitled "Population of the City of New York, Plotted by Sanitary Districts from the  Fedearl Census of 1930', edited  by Mr. E. M. Law, engineer  of the Board's Department of Law and Real Estate."(4)
Laidlaw keeps explaining how the built this system--maybe seeking credit, but clearly seeking  credibility, for some reason---but cannot ignore that he puts himself at the fore of this story...

"Meantime the Department of Health, by permanent groupings of 'sanitary districts' now again known , officially, as 'census tracts', into 'health areas', through the Research Bureau of the Welfare Council of New York, had organized its system of vital statistics for the whole city in ters of 311 health area aggregations  of the 3,411 census tracts reported on by the Census Bureau in 1930."(4)

"In its compilations, based on census tract data, the Department of Health has had little or no occasion for the use of the populations of individual blocks."(4)
"In the use of census data by the Board of Transportation, however, the writer was called on, before the census year of 1930 had run its course, to furnish  the populations  of individual blocks  of the city as on April 1, 1930."(4)
"THe Board, for planning of new subways, needed data showing the effect of the existing subways on the increases of populations and property values adjacent to  subway lines, with subways themselves as boundaries for north-south, or  east-west  summations of  blocks to distances of two blocks, of three blocks, or more, from subway lines."(4)
"The Census Bureau, previously to its special tabulation, through PWA funds, for New York State's proposed reapportionment, of the block populations of New York State's cities, as in 1930, had no such figures, except for blocks singly constituting enumeration district assignments."(4)
[COME BACK -- is  this a citizen-only apportionment!?]

context is Laidlaw says he did a story for 1930 book on efffect of subways on population and then showed City Transportation people: "These decentralization figures, in advance of their general publication, were supplied the Board of Transportation by the writer, and  when that BOard declared to him its need, in addition to them, and in addition to tract population figures, of individual block populations, to evaluate  the effect of each individual subway on population movement and property values in territory adjacent thereto, the writer saw such a confirmation of the value of a permanent notation for each block within permanent census tract outlines, for a record of block populations from census to census, that he determined, if possible, when the Board of Estimate's sectional maps were revised for the taking and tabulating  of the census succeeding that of 1930, to secure, for all blocks of all five boroughs, within census tract outlines, alphabetic notations similar to and, so far as possible, identical with, those given by  him to the blocks of all boroughs except Richmond for a block tabulation record of the State Census of 1925 and used in the actual enumeration of 1930 by the Federal Census Bureau." (5)

"The Census Bureau decided in  1930 to enumerate the populations of all large cities of the Nation, by blocks, as a permanent procedure. All of the Nation's large cities, following the lead of New York, are now tabulated by census tracts, and the Bureau welcomed, in 1930, the block notation maps of 1926, for four of  New York's boroughs, as heartily as it had welcomed the census tact outlines preapred for it at every census, 1910-1930. The Geographer found, however, in actual use of the maps of 1930, so many street locations and nomenclatures which did not agree  with the streets and nomenclatures discovered by enumerators in their coverage of the blocks or  groups of blocks assigned  them, that the writer knew, as early as 1931, that the block notations,  as well as the tract boundaries of the whole city, would need  a minute revision before the next Federal Census to conform with the actual status of the discoverableness  and designations of the city's streets, within tract boundaries, as mapped on Board of Estimate section maps...The Geographer, moreover, emphasized the need of eliminating all instances where tract boundary lines  were run through block areas, rather than around them, on the latest street layout of the city, to conform with the Bureau's policy of enumerating blocks as wholes."(6)

looking to possibility that it will "make possible the periodic secural from Washington of such block population data as Albany will require at each legislative reapportionment of the area of New York State"(6)

"The State Census of 1925 has been superceded by the Federal Censuses of 1930 and thereafter as the source for population data to guide a reapportionment of the State into congressional, state senatorial, and state assembly districts as last effected by Chapter 778, Laws of 1917."(6)

"This is the result, following the debacle of the State Census of  1925, of the adoption of an amendment of Article III, Section  4, of the State Constitution." (7)

b/c constitution says blocks cannot be divided in forming senate disticts in NYS: "The Federal Census is not therefore usable as a basis of reapportionment of senate and assembly districts in New York City unless the city is mapped by blocks enclosed by streets or public ways as a preliminary to accurate enumeration, and the rigor of such requirement is increased by the fact that the population of each enumerated block must, to conform with the Constitution of New York State, distinguish between citizen and alien inhabitants." (7)
"A block notation system  for New York City is therefore not  only usable  by and  welcome to  Washington, in connection with its adopted method of the block  enumeration of  all large cities, but at the  same time essential  to Albany's  convenient  use of Washington's certification  of  citizen and alien population in each block  as a preliminary  of reapportionment." (7)

"The Board of Transportation,  to this day, has not in its possession  the block populations of 1930, however useful such information might be for the determination of the city's subway policies."(7)
"The only informaiton it has concerning the breakup of census tracts are the populations of their constituent enumeration districts, sometimes comprised of many blocks."(7)

"For the information of the State Legislature still in session Governor Lehman had to interest the Census Bureau in supervising and certifying the work of a PWA staff, in making a block tabulation of citizens and aliens from the enumeration sheets of 1930."(7)
"When the Legislature is through with the special Census Bureau report in its hands these block popultions, as of 1930, may be available for the Board of Transportation, and for such other city departments as would benefit by having in hand not only the detailed statistical area and census tract populations of the 1930 Census but the individual block populations within each  census tract in 1930."(7) *****!!!!!

"If, from census to census, the City of New York can forever more have, as it will, in all likelihood, from the Federal Census, not only the aggregate and the detailed population of each census tract, but also the aggregate population of each block in each census tract, every department of the City will be in a  position, for a reasonable period succeeding each census, to ask the Census Bureau to amke fo rit at actual working cost a special tabulation of the cards of any block whose population characteristics and composition may seem advantageous to the administration of that department."(7-8)

claims Tenement House Department born from his report in 1898 "that the most populous block in the city was not, as popularly supposed, south of 14th Street, on the East Side, but north of 59th Street, on the West Side, and that it contained over 6,000 inhabitants."(8)
"It is the block designated M147G-Block G, Tract 147, Borough of Manhattan, census tract block map, and the four 'streets or public ways' bounding it are West 62nd, Amsterdam Ave., West 61st, West End Ave."(8)

Tenement House Department wanted full tabualtion for 49,000 blocks by "sex, age, color, nativity, etc." but Census Bureau balked at the magnitude--and so the census tract was a compromise (8-9)

"The Federation of Churches bore teh expense of the publication of the census tract drata of 1910, the New York City 1920 Census Committee the expense of 1920, and the Cities Census Committee and Welfare Council the expense of 1930. The Federal Census has published much detail of the 64 statistical areas set up, 1930, to displace the assembly districts units of 1910 and 1920, but has never published any details of census tracts,---even of their aggregate population."(10)

on 1910 tract publishing: "The writer therefore advanced the money to engage and remunerate a staff of thirteen Census Bureau employees to make ready, for lithographic reproduction, the sheets of the 708 tracts. It requried over $5,000, mainly borrowed, and borrowed with such difficulty that, had the tracts been more numerous, it is questionable whether the money requried could have been obtained."(11)
"WHen the sheets of the publication were in the Federation's hands, however, the mere exhibition  of one of them to a public-spirited citizen brought a gift to the Federation of a sum sufficient to repay all the writer's borrowings, and provide a publication fund, which, supplemented by the purchases of two copies of the publication by the Deaprtment of Education and Department of Health, at $500 each, brougth the Federation's outlays on the first census tract publication of the city 'out of the red'." (11)

cost of system from 1906 to 1933 was over $250,000

Board of Education in NYC an early purchaser of first tract maps and then tract block maps (12)

in 1934, Laidlaw winds up meeting Dr. Carol Aronovici, Director of Columbia University Housing Orientation Study (Carol is a "he")
"Dr. Aronovici asked the writer to come on the staff of the Study, and take charge of Map Standardization based on the expansion of census tract maps into census tract block maps, and extended, ultimately, to the coordination of the administrative work of all city departments with census tract groupings as definite as then existing coordiantions of the Heealth Department therewith."(16)

another block use: "The intention of the Tenement House Department to produce a Real Property Inventory of housing conditions in each block of the city and to tabulate the same by census tracts."(20)

Laidlaw's 1934 work also moves from Board of Estimate maps to the Census maps fit to the existing 64 statistical areas
more details of production follow, but am skipping for now...

"If sovereign states may form a federal nation, why not the independent denominations act together through a federation of churches?...First steps toward such an organization were taken at a meeting of the Union Seminary Alumni Club by one hundred clergymen representing seven denominations. Dr. Walter Laidlaw became the secretary of the new federation. It has developed into a complete religious census bureau, of demonstrated value to all churches and social workers."

"It is necessary to know the conditions which favor and oppose the extension of the Kingdom, the exact causes of the evils they are to overpower, and the resources at their command. If the churches are to know the social, civic, economic, political, and church conditions, interdenominational commissions will be necessary to secure exact information. Already the influence of the Association for the Advancement of the Interest of Labor of the Episcopal Church has stimulated a labor commission in the Congregational and Presbyterian bodies. The first work of local federation is a scientific study of conditions revealed by a thorough canvass of the entire community so that churches may know the complete situation which confronts or surrounds them. The practical working of this has resulted in an increase of the field which belongs to the Church by preference, e.g., several hundred familes have been added to the care of certain city churches, altho the pastors had supposed that they had throughly searched their entire community. In my own parish our canvass gave eighty names not on the church roll."(363)

"In the State of Maine the churches by combining have exerted a most wholesome controlling influence upon legislation, and have without doubt prevented the State from returning to the liquor traffic.  A few years ago the city of Hartford became so immoral and the streets so offensive from the placarding of obscene pictures that the churches federated in behalf of municipal morality and most effectively cleaned the city within a few weeks." (364)

"But, as said, with two notable exceptions, namely, in the cities of New York and Providence, federation is not an accomplished fact in the heart of the churches. In New York especially federation has accomplished a work and attained a degree of success that make every friend of the movement believe that it must become a fact among the churches of America. Rev. Dr. Walter Laidlaw, the head of the organization, is a born organizer, a statistician, and a man with the enthusiasm and persistence of ten common men. Within ten years he has built up the most complete bureau of church information in all Christendom. So comprehensive are the sociological facts that he has amassed that not only have many Protestant churches of the city, but even Hebrews and Catholics, and the tenements and charities departments of the city government, and many independent philanthropic organizations, come to lean upon him and his bureau for help in their work. The Board of Aldermen, the Rapid Transit Commission, and even many individual business men, go to consult him, for he not only gathers a multitude of facts, but he has knowledge of the meaning of these facts that perhaps no other man in  the  city possesses."(364)
"Dr. Laidlaw's plan of work is to make a religious and sociological census of the entire city every five years by Assembly districts, and an annual census of the city by blocks and wards. He has not completely carried out his plan because of the lack of money: but through the direct work of his own central federation and the assistance of subfederations working under his direction he has made an annual count for the population and its church and sociological conditions in Manhattan borough, and within ten years he has made two most accurate comparative census studies of some of the most populous Assembly districts, notably the Fourteenth Assembly District, on the East Side below Fourteenth Street, one of the most crowded cosmopolitan communities in the world. The Central Federation canvassers go from house to house until every house in an Assembly district has been visited. The following questions are asked of the heads of  every family or occupant of an apartment: Name of family, length of residence in house, number in family, floor, owner of house, rent of apartment, number of children, nationality, father and mother, denomination and church if any, Bible in the house, boarders, domestics, boys and girls one to two years of age, three to seven years of age, and eight to fifteen years of age, and in school." (364-365)
"The gathering of this information is done by federation staff experts, usually men from theological seminaries trained along these lines. While these canvassers are backed by no law to compel people to answer questions, yet more than ninety-five per cent of the people approached promptly answer all the questions, and the only serious impediment to collecting this information is lack of a sufficient staff of canvassers. The information is tabulated on cards by  a set of electrical dial and punching machines, similar to those in the Federal Census Office at Washington."(365)
"Then Dr. Laidlaw and his staff of experts sit down to study the wonders they had found; and nothing more fascinates the mind of this church organizer than the review of such facts. He saw what he had before known, that the Protestant churches in New York were working blindfolded, and did not know, where many of the people were, nor how to reach them. He saw more than a million Protestants in Greater New York unaccounted for on the rolls of the churches. He saw churches starving because many of their members had suddenly moved away to other parts of the city, and he saw other churches wasting their money to fin dtheir people by counting thousands of people who id not belong to them. He saw new church buildings going up in localities where there was no substantial basis for their support; and he actually saw deserted churches in neighborhoods full of their own communicants."(365)

"More than two hundred fo the most progressive churches assume the task of taking an annual census of the parish, each church covering a certain territory...Every dwelling is visited, and Hebrews and Roman Catholics, as well as Protestants, are duly tabulated in the reports. Some Jewish rabbis and Roman Catholic priests have acknowledged the aid such reports have given them, by contributing money to the Central Federation."(365)

"Thus the sociological studies carried on so successfully by this church and philanthropic federation in New York duplicates nothing doen by the national census. These studies are designed, among other things, to answer the following questions:
"Where ought religious and philanthropic work be commenced or reduced in New York?
"For whom should work be designed?
"Among what groups should it be deserted?
"By whom should it be instituted or given up?
"How should the district under study be divided for cooperative work?" (365)

then goes on to list changes made b/c of this census data, including public baths opened, parks created, a settlement house opened, churches were sited --- "Scores of model tenement-houses, fruit and flower missions, and kindergartens have been established on recommendations based upon Dr. Laidlaw's reports." (366) -- note this is also about finding particular unchurched families (and so also not that different from using federal census to find deaf individuals...)

But thought these programs covered roughly 60 percent of the nation's population, they covered only 2 percent of the national geography and could not rapidly be expanded to the remaining states and jurisdictions."(222)
