maybe make this a post about Elbertie Foudray and contrast it with this imagery, where women are the rote computers...

create image cutting out the woman operator and replacing it with Uncle Sam instead!

great photos here: http://www.fdrlibrary.marist.edu/archives/collections/franklin/index.php?p=digitallibrary/thumbnails&q=census

do this piece after the enumerator posts...


the point of this piece would be to show off some of the pictures of the new machines, which have been a center of much of the census story

but don't write off and even emphasize the extent to which the census was a key institution shaping the history of computing (like DARPA but less sexy)

but then instead focus on the census as a human machine, as emblematic of new forms of labor, of the rise of offices, of feminized mechanical labor, and auguring algorithmic unemployment (except the number of enumerators skyrockets even as the sample takes hold...what is up?) too

get toward the idea that a nation can be ruled from an office building
