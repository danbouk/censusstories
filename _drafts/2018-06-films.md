look at Knowing USA film and meditate here on the language of "inventory": “In April 1940, 120,000 census takers are radiating in a carefully planned pattern across America to complete in a single month the greatest inventory of the world’s greatest democracy.”

<!-- Bureau of the Census, “Know Your USA” (1940)-->


look for Pare Lorenz in the census too... (note I don't have to make this up---around image 474 in Dedrick 1 there are documents showing a study guide for "The River" with other film stuff)

post about making the instruction films...

begin with letters from the film people saying they heard the films weren't being used...
