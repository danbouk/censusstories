The census of 1940 proved to Stuart Chase that the U.S. population [could now be accurately predicted](/2018/05/26/predictable-population-1940.html). Of course, he was wrong, but he did not know that. More importantly, the (wrong) predictions he now believed pointed toward a conclusion he was glad to embrace. America was *on the path to maturity*, and as a mature nation it not only could be better managed by a new technocratic elite, but indeed would *have to be managed*.

It did not bother Chase that "mature" could mean more than one thing. He played with those multiple meanings. The America he anticipated would be older (in average population) and in that way mature. That sense of maturity could even be graphed:

Yet maturity also implied that the nation, like a person, had entered a new phase of life. It had "grown up":
>“The 1940 Census is one of the great landmarks of American history. It proves that we have grown up. The problems of maturity are different from the problems of adolescence, but who will they are more difficult? We are presented with a grave threat and a great promise. Maturity often brings wisdom. Shall we be wise enough to avoid the threat and seize the promise?” (28-29)


“But we have had very little experience in managing intensive investment, little experience with a mature economic system. What experience we got in the 1930s was not very pleasant, partly because so many of us refused to face the readjustment. In particular, many of us rebelled vigorously at government interference. The government interference which defense is bringing ins more palatable. When we readjust to postwar conditions plus population trouble, we shall need our government as never before.” (25)

“The gross effect of these changes is likely to be more of the same medicine over which we have made such wry faces in the past eight years—government planning and control.
“A stationary community needs more careful planning than an expanding one. It needs most planning of all at the outset, to meet the dangers of transition. There are now some 132 million citizens to be protected. To some of them the changes in business will be a life and death matter.” (25-26)


“If the birth rate of this country or any country can be stimulated at all, it will only be by a broad and indirect improvement of living conditions—by more opportunity, economic security, public health measures, better housing. Children cannot be planted by the acre, like wheat. But the field can be made more fertile.” (27)
